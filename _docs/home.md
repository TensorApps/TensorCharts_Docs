If you  ask an economist what price action indicates, his/her answer would immediately  reference the equilibrium point between Supply and Demand -and that’s what the Order Flow can tell you..

So there you have it,  the whole story, no speculation.  Once you are  accustomed to what it means when price movements occur (order flow), you will  be able to recognize  price action and articulate price action from an analytical  perspective. Acquiring this fundamental will afford you the wisdom to exploit any trading market’s needs, wants or desires. 

In short, pun intended, investors and traders alike,  find value in interpreting price action and quickly recognize the Order Flow as an indicator and the  many vantage points it offers in trading a market. Explore TensorCharts.com and find your vantage point.  Learn them all, and enjoy watching your revenue and confidence grow.
